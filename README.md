# Lab_Candidate_Assignment
This is a task designed for potential lab candidates for the Neuroeconomics Lab at Temple University.

The following data is from an ongoing study in our lab. The task that this data is pulled from asks participants to choose between a monetary amount and a set size containing various snack items. These decisions are made for themselves and their partner (who is completing the same task as them). The key to this data can be found in SetSize_TaskB_Key.xlsx.

Your task is to create plots for this data in Matlab and/or Python to summarize the following:
1. Average response times (for participants choosing for themselves and choosing for their partners; no computer responses) for Choice 2 across all set size (2, 3, 6, 12) conditions.
2. Average response times (for participants choosing for themselves and choosing for their partners; no computer responses) for Choice 2 across all monetary (0.5, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75) conditions.
3. Average snack ratings between Task A, Task B (participants choosing for themselves), and Task B (participants choosing for their partners).

Please email these completed charts to DVSNEUROECONLAB@gmail.com with the subject line "Lab Candidate Assignment" as well as the code(s) you used to plot your charts.
