# Lab_Candidate_Assignment
This is a task designed for potential lab candidates for the Neuroeconomics Lab at Temple University.

The following data is from a previous study in our lab. The task that this data is pulled from asks participants to choose between a monetary amount and sets containing various items. These decisions are made for themselves and their partner (who is completing the same task as them). The keys to this data can be found in TaskA_Key.csv and TaskB_Key.csv .

Your task is to create plots for this data in Matlab, R, and/or Python to summarize the following:
1. Average response times (for participants choosing for themselves and choosing for their partners; no computer responses) for Choice 1 across all set size (2, 3, 6, 12) conditions.
2. Average response times (for participants choosing for themselves and choosing for their partners; no computer responses) for Choice 2 across all monetary (0.5, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75) conditions.
3. Average snack preference ratings between Task A, Task B (participants choosing for themselves), and Task B (participants choosing for their partners).

*This must be written in either Matlab, R, and/or Python.*

*You must show all of your work in a GitHub repository.*

*Graphs should include error bars representing the standard error of the means.*
